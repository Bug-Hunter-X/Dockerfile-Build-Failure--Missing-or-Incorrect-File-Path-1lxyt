This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images: the `CMD` instruction in the Dockerfile points to a non-existent file or an incorrect file path.  The original Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) will fail to build because it attempts to execute `app.py`, which is not included or located in the specified path. The corrected version (`Dockerfile_fixed`) addresses this issue by properly copying the `app.py` file into the image and using the correct path in the `CMD` instruction.  This example uses a simple Python application, but the principle applies to any language or application type.
